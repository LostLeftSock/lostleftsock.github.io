            "The client had an existing automation dashboard that was used to create, monitor, deploy, and analyze bot traffic for a number of services. The initial task was for us to take the existing UI and a layer of polish to it so that it could be shared with executives.",

This presented a considerable challenge in creating a more harmonious experience. We decided to go with something that was a little more modern and brought color and icons into the navigation.",
