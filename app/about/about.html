                <h2>Hello, I'm <span class="fw-bold">James Elder</span></h2>
                <p>I’m an entrepreneurial, energetic leader with a proven track record for developing and shipping cutting edge concepts and products. I have experience in all aspects of the product life cycle including research, requirements, design, user experience, usability, and analytics, having served as both individual contributor and team lead for each discipline. I’ve managed local and fully-remote teams, both onsite and offshore, across companies and cultures.</p>
                <p>I love leading teams in creating engaging experiences that delight users. There’s nothing more exciting than seeing someone get a spark of joy from a fun micro-animation or enable someone to complete a task more quickly because of a better user flow or simplified navigation. </p>
                <p>Over my career, I've been fortunate to work on and lead a number of exciting projects including marketing website redesigns, web applications, a real time messaging platform, a bots platform, and a custom CMS platform that was used by over 30 unique brands. I was also able to create an iPhone app, animations, games, and more.</p>
                <p>Whatever your needs or goals, I would love to help you accomplish them. Let me know about your next project and together we can make the web an amazing place to discover, learn, and play.</p>

                    <p>Jim is a user experience polymath. He understands how to manage a data driven UX design, he has an extensive front end development background that informs awareness of the level of effort he requires, and to top it all off he has fantastic aesthetic instincts. While his passion for good process and senior level experience mean he truly shines in a leadership role, he's not afraid to get down in the weeds when timelines call for it.</p>
