                <p>Each project brings with it unique challenges to solve and it’s more important to look at the big picture, and what needs to be accomplished overall, than follow a rigid process. I’ve joined projects at all different stages, and I’ve adjusted my approach each time to deliver what will make the biggest impact. </p>

                            <p>We take time to get to know your users. We’ll start this phase with data and competitive analysis, user testing, interviews and surveys. We’ll end with creating personas, user flows, and the Information architecture needed for the product.</p>
